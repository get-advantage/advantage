- Strategic direction of the project
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing releases
- Maintaining project infrastructure
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct
- Making decisions about project governance

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers

**Maintainers** are trusted individuals with commit access to the repository who actively manage the project, review contributions, and ensure the project follows its mission and code of conduct.

**Types of Maintainers:**

1. **Core Maintainers**: Have full administrative access and can make decisions on all aspects of the project
2. **Area Maintainers**: Focus on specific areas (e.g., documentation, formats, messaging, CI/CD) with commit access to relevant parts of the codebase

### Contributors

**Contributors** are community members who contribute to the project through:
- Code contributions
- Documentation improvements

Contributors do not have commit access but are essential to the project's success.

### Supporting Members

**Supporting Members** are organizations or individuals who:
- Implement the Advantage technology
- Use Advantage standards for buying/selling
- Endorse the project's mission
- Provide resources or funding (optional)

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are expected to:

### Code & Technical Review

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus-Seeking

The Advantage project follows a **consensus-seeking decision-making process**:

1. **Proposal**: Any maintainer or contributor can propose changes via GitHub issues or discussions
2. **Discussion**: Open discussion period (minimum 72 hours for minor changes, 1 week for major changes)
3. **Consensus Building**: Maintainers work to reach consensus through discussion
4. **Resolution**: 
   - If consensus is reached, the decision is implemented
   - If consensus cannot be reached, a simple majority vote of core maintainers decides
   - For critical decisions (governance changes, major architectural changes), 2/3 majority of core maintainers is required

### Decision Levels

**Minor Decisions** (Fast-track, 72 hours):
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Dependency updates
- Minor feature additions

**Major Decisions** (Standard, 1 week):
- New features or formats
- Breaking changes
- Architectural changes
- New maintainer appointments

**Critical Decisions** (Extended, 2 weeks):
- Governance changes
- Code of Conduct changes
- Major architectural rewrites
- Maintainer removal

### Emergency Decisions

In case of security issues or critical bugs, any core maintainer can make immediate decisions and implement fixes. These must be communicated to all maintainers within 24 hours.

## Maintainer Meetings

### Monthly Maintainer Meetings

The maintainer committee holds regular monthly meetings on the **first Wednesday of each month** to:
- Review project status and health metrics

### Nomination Process

1. **Nomination**: Any current maintainer can nominate a contributor by:
   - Opening a private discussion with the maintainer committee
   - Providing evidence of the nominee's contributions and qualifications
   - Explaining the value the nominee would bring to the team

2. **Self-Nomination**: Contributors may also nominate themselves by:

   - Evaluation period: 1-2 weeks

4. **Decision**:
   - Simple majority vote of core maintainers
   - Decision communicated to the nominee privately

   - If declined, constructive feedback provided with path forward

5. **Onboarding**:
   - Grant repository access (appropriate level)
   - Add to maintainer communication channels
   - Pair with an existing maintainer for mentorship
   - Add to MAINTAINERS.md and all-contributors
   - Announce to the community

### Probationary Period

New maintainers (especially Core Maintainers) may start with a 3-month probationary period where:
- They have full technical access but observe major decisions
- A mentor maintainer provides guidance
- Performance and fit are evaluated
- At the end, the committee confirms or extends the probation

## Maintainer Expectations

### Code of Conduct

All maintainers must:
- Exemplify the Code of Conduct in all interactions
- Handle enforcement issues professionally and fairly
- Recuse themselves from decisions where they have conflicts of interest
- Maintain confidentiality when handling sensitive issues

### Communication

Maintainers should:
- Be responsive and transparent
- Communicate availability and time constraints
- Participate in maintainer discussions
- Keep the community informed of major decisions
- Be respectful and constructive in all communications

### Stepping Down

Maintainers who need to step down should:
- Notify the maintainer committee at least 2 weeks in advance
- Help with knowledge transfer
- Complete or hand off critical in-progress work
- Move to Maintainer Emeritus status

## Maintainer Emeritus

Maintainers who step down in good standing become **Maintainers Emeritus** and:
- Retain recognition for their contributions
- Are listed in MAINTAINERS.md with emeritus status
- Can attend maintainer discussions (without voting rights)
- Have an expedited path to return to active maintainer status
- May be consulted on important project decisions

### Returning from Emeritus

A maintainer emeritus can return to active status by:
- Expressing interest to the maintainer committee
- Demonstrating renewed commitment and availability
- Simple majority approval from core maintainers

## Inactive Maintainers

If a maintainer becomes inactive (no participation for 6+ months) without prior notice:
- The maintainer committee will attempt to contact them
- After 30 days with no response, they may be moved to emeritus status
- This is done respectfully and gratefully
- They retain the path to return as described above

## Removal of Maintainers

In rare cases, a maintainer may be removed for:
- Violation of the Code of Conduct
- Abuse of maintainer privileges
- Repeated failure to meet maintainer responsibilities
- Actions that harm the project or community

**Process:**
1. Private discussion among core maintainers
2. Attempt to resolve issues through dialogue
3. If resolution fails, 2/3 majority vote of core maintainers (excluding the person in question)
4. Private notification with explanation
5. Public announcement (details shared based on privacy and legal considerations)

## Conflict Resolution

### Levels of Conflict

1. **Contributor-to-Contributor**: Resolve directly or with maintainer mediation
2. **Contributor-to-Maintainer**: Another maintainer mediates
3. **Maintainer-to-Maintainer**: Core maintainers mediate collectively
4. **Unresolved Conflicts**: Escalate to vote following decision-making process

### Mediation Principles

- Assume good intent
- Listen actively and empathetically
- Focus on issues, not personalities
- Seek win-win solutions
- Document agreements
- Follow up to ensure resolution
