## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. For Advantage developers, this means your AI assistant can:

-   **Access live documentation** - Get real-time information from the latest docs
-   **Search code examples** - Find relevant implementation patterns instantly
-   **Understand context** - AI assistants gain deep knowledge about Advantage APIs and concepts
-   **Stay synchronized** - Always work with the most current information

## Key Benefits

### 🔄 **Always Up-to-Date**

Unlike static documentation snapshots, the MCP server provides access to the live documentation directly from the repository. This means you'll never work with outdated information.

### 🎯 **Contextual Assistance**

Your AI assistant understands the full context of Advantage, including:

-   Format specifications (Topscroll, Midscroll, Welcome Page, etc.)
-   Messaging protocol details
-   Integration patterns
-   Best practices and examples

### 🚀 **Faster Development**

Get instant answers to questions like:

-   "How do I implement a custom format integration?"
-   "What are the available configuration options for the wrapper?"
-   "Show me an example of the messaging protocol in action"

### 🔍 **Intelligent Search**

The MCP server enables semantic search across the entire Advantage ecosystem, helping you find relevant information even when you don't know the exact terms.
