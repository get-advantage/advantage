# Wrapper

The Wrapper is a web component that acts as a container or placeholder for ad placements on a webpage. It's designed to securely and efficiently load the designated [format](formats.md) into the page's content, ensuring that ads are displayed in the intended manner without disrupting the user experience or site layout.

<div class="tip custom-block" style="padding-top: 8px">
  ℹ️ Using the Advantage Wrapper is highly recommended as it makes implementing Advantage high-impact formats on your website quick and easy. But if you already have custom implementations of the formats that you want, you can choose not to use the wrapper.
