# Integrations

Integrations specify how a webpage incorporates an ad [format](./formats.md). This involves scripting and configuration that dictate where and how an ad format is displayed within the page. Integrations are responsible page-specific adjustments, such as modifying ad behavior or appearance to better fit the page's context without altering the base format.

Each integration represents the connection between page and format (like Midscroll or Welcome page). Integration are either provided by AdVantage as templates or implemented by you.
