# Our Story

In the wake of the post-third-party-script era, publishers faced a critical need to control high-impact webpage content for security, performance, and alignment with website code. Recognizing this challenge, [Madington](https://www.madington.com), a tech vendor specializing in high-impact advertising, introduced Advantage, a library designed to streamline and standardize the implementation of high-impact formats.

Aimed at standardizing the buying process across direct and programmatic channels, there was a clear need for full industry collaboration. **Advantage was gifted to the industry by Madington in April 2024** and perfected by community collaboration ever since.
