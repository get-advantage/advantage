## Introducing the Advantage Messaging Protocol {#protocol}

The Advantage Messaging Protocol revolutionizes the delivery and display of high-impact advertisements on websites. It streamlines the communication between ad creatives and web platforms, ensuring ads are not only displayed correctly but also make a significant impression on viewers. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initialization**: Upon being loaded into a webpage, an ad – whether placed directly or via programmatic channels – identifies itself as complying with the Advantage format standard using the Advantage messaging protocol.
2. **Communication**: The website receives this notification and checks its configuration to determine if the ad's format is supported.
3. **Adaptation**: If the website supports the format, it adjusts the ad slot or placement to accommodate the creative, ensuring the ad displays as intended.
4. **Success**: The ad is seamlessly integrated into the webpage, optimized to capture viewer attention and drive engagement.

The Advantage protocol is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring an easy-to-use API that facilitates quick adoption by creatives and website owners alike. If your website is already equipped with high-impact ad formats, integrating the Advantage messaging protocol will elevate your advertising effectiveness to new heights.

Embrace the future of online advertising with the Advantage Messaging Protocol – where every ad has the potential to make a lasting impact.

## What is a high-impact ad format?

as Advantage aims to support a wide variety of formats.
