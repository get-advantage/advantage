## Advantage Messaging Protocol {#protocol}
### Introduction
The Advantage Messaging Protocol streamlines the communication between ad creatives and websites, ensuring ads are displayed correctly regardless of buying channel (Direct or programmatic) or safe frames. The messaging protocol allows the publisher website to either confirm or reject reuqested formats from the advertisement code - when the reuqest is confirmed by the website the ad container will adjust to the requested format. This interaction occurs seamlessly via the secure messaging protocol ensuring that advertisements can elevate their presence without compromising the integrity or security of the webpage.

### Here’s how it works:

1. **Initialization**: Upon being loaded into a webpage, an ad creative identifies itself as complying with the **Advantage format standard** using the Advantage messaging protocol.
2. **Communication**: The website receives this notification and checks its configuration to determine if the requested format is supported.
3. **Adaptation**: If the website supports the format and confirms the request, it adjusts the ad slot or placement to accommodate the creative, ensuring the ad displays as intended.
4. **Success**: The ad is seamlessly integrated into the webpage, optimized to capture viewer attention and drive engagement.

### Implementation 
The Advantage protocol is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring an easy-to-use API that facilitates quick adoption by creatives and website owners. If your website is already equipped with high-impact ad formats, the Advantage messaging protocol can be used as stand alone to standardise the communication between the advertisement and website.
