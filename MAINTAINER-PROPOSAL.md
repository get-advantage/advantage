# Maintainer Program Proposal - Executive Summary

## Overview

This proposal establishes a formal governance structure for the Advantage open-source project, defining maintainer roles, responsibilities, and processes for bringing trusted community members into project leadership.

## Problem Statement

As Advantage grows, we need a clear structure to:
- Scale project management beyond the founding team
- Distribute responsibility and workload
- Empower community members to take ownership
- Ensure sustainable long-term project health
- Maintain quality and consistency

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Governance Structure

We propose a **maintainer-driven governance model** with three tiers:

```
Maintainer Committee (Decision-making)
├── Core Maintainers (Full oversight)
├── Area Maintainers (Domain-specific)
└── Community
    ├── Contributors
    └── Supporting Members
```

### 2. Maintainer Roles

**Core Maintainers**
- Full administrative access
- Strategic decision-making
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Project-wide oversight

**Area Maintainers**
- Domain expertise (formats, docs, testing, design)
- Focused responsibilities
- Commit access to relevant areas
- Reduced time commitment option

### 3. Key Responsibilities

All maintainers commit to:
- ✅ Review PRs within 1 week
- ✅ Respond to issues and community questions
- ✅ Participate in maintainer discussions
- ✅ Follow and enforce Code of Conduct
- ✅ Maintain documentation
- ✅ Mentor contributors
- ✅ Bi-weekly engagement minimum

### 4. Becoming a Maintainer

**Eligibility Criteria:**
1. **Technical Excellence**: 5+ merged PRs, code quality, architectural understanding
2. **Community Engagement**: Helpful reviews, issue triage, mentoring others
3. **Commitment**: 3+ months consistent contributions, demonstrated reliability
4. **Domain Expertise**: (for Area Maintainers) Deep knowledge in specific area

**Process:**
1. Nomination by existing maintainer OR self-nomination
2. 1-2 week evaluation by maintainer committee
3. Simple majority vote
4. Onboarding with mentor support
5. Optional 3-month probation for Core Maintainers

### 5. Decision-Making Process

**Consensus-Seeking Model:**
- Minor decisions (bugs, docs): 72 hours, consensus or majority
- Major decisions (features, architecture): 1 week, consensus or majority
- Critical decisions (governance, breaking changes): 2 weeks, 2/3 majority
- Emergency (security): Immediate action, notify within 24 hours

### 6. Maintainer Lifecycle

**Active → Emeritus → Inactive/Return**

- **Stepping Down**: Graceful exit with 2-week notice, becomes Emeritus
- **Emeritus Status**: Recognition retained, expedited return path
- **Inactive**: After 6 months no contact, moved to Emeritus respectfully
- **Removal**: Only for Code of Conduct violations (2/3 vote required)

### 7. Operational Structure

**Monthly Maintainer Meetings:**
- Held on the first Wednesday of each month
- Review project health, make decisions, plan releases
- Meeting notes published in GitHub Discussions
- Community members can propose agenda items

**Project Management:**
- **GitHub Projects**: Public roadmap showing Planned, In Progress (WIP), and Shipped items
- **GitHub Discussions**: Primary forum for community conversation and collaboration
- Transparent workflow for contributors to see where they can help

**Inclusive Community:**
We welcome contributions from diverse stakeholders:
- **Publishers**: Implement and improve Advantage
- **Agencies & Advertisers**: Share use cases and feedback  
- **Developers**: Contribute code, documentation, and examples
- **Industry Experts**: Help define standards and best practices

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure program success:

- **Growth**: Number of active maintainers over time
- **Diversity**: Geographic, organizational, and demographic diversity across stakeholder types
- **Health**: Average PR review time, issue response time
- **Engagement**: Maintainer participation in discussions/decisions/meetings
- **Retention**: Maintainer tenure and satisfaction
- **Community**: Contributor growth, new contributor onboarding success
- **Transparency**: GitHub Projects usage, meeting attendance, discussion participation
- **Stakeholder Representation**: Balance of publishers, agencies, developers, and experts

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Too few nominees | Medium | Actively recruit, recognize contributors |
| Maintainer burnout | High | Reasonable expectations, emeritus path, area maintainers |
| Decision paralysis | Medium | Clear timelines, fallback to voting |
| Quality concerns | High | Probation period, clear standards, mentorship |
| Conflicts | Medium | Clear CoC, conflict resolution process |

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Founding team reviews all governance documents
2. **Customize**: Adjust any sections for Advantage specifics
3. **Approve**: Get formal sign-off from current leadership
4. **Announce**: Share with community via blog post, GitHub, Slack
5. **Implement**: Begin accepting nominations immediately

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Timing**: When should we officially launch the maintainer program?
2. **Initial Maintainers**: Should we "grandfather in" existing top contributors?
3. **Compensation**: Any plans for paid maintainer positions in the future?
4. **Legal**: Any legal review needed (especially for "Supporting Members")?
5. **Communication**: What's the best way to announce this to the community?

## Conclusion

This maintainer program provides Advantage with a solid foundation for sustainable growth. By clearly defining roles, responsibilities, and processes, we empower community members to take ownership while maintaining quality and alignment with project values.

The governance structure is flexible enough to evolve with the project while providing enough structure to scale effectively. Most importantly, it creates clear pathways for contributors to deepen their involvement and recognition.
